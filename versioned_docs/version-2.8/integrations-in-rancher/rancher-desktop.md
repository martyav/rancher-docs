Developing and testing cloud-native applications on your desktop requires a set of foundational blocks such as a virtual machine (if on macOS or Windows), a container run time, Kubernetes, popular utilities, etc. Installing these components individually and getting them to work with each other can get pesky at times. Rancher Desktop nicely bundles all these essential building blocks into an easily installable and manageable desktop application that offers the key features below. 

- Simple and easy installation on macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems.
- A ready to use light weight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) and the ability to pick Kubernetes versions.
- GUI-based cluster dashboard powered by Rancher to explore your local cluster.
- Freedom to choose between multiple container engines (dockerd(moby) vs. containerd).
- Preferences settings to configure the application to fit your needs.
- Bundled tools required for your container, Kubernetes-based development, operations workflows.
- Periodic updates to maintain the bundled toolsâ€™ versions up to date.
- Integrates with proven tools/IDEs (VS Code extensions, Skaffold, etc). 
- Image & Registry access control.
- Support for Docker extensions.
