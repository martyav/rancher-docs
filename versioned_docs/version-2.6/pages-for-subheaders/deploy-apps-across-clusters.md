Rancher v2.5 introduced Fleet, a new way to deploy applications across clusters.

Continuous Delivery with Fleet is GitOps at scale. For more information, refer to the [Fleet section](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/deploy-apps-across-clusters/fleet.md).

### Multi-cluster Apps

In Rancher before v2.5, the multi-cluster apps feature was used to deploy applications across clusters. The multi-cluster apps feature is deprecated, but still available in Rancher v2.5.

See the [multi-cluster app documentation](../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/deploy-apps-across-clusters/multi-cluster-apps.md) for more details.
