<!-- This page uses HTML definition list tags. dl indicates the start and end of a definition list. dt indicates the defined term, and dd the definition. These will stay in place until we upgrade to Docusaurus 3 and are able to add the remark-definition-list plugin for native Markdown syntax. We are currently blocked as the plugin requires a handler that isn't currently exposed. See https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/8743#discussioncomment-6085581 and https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9674 -->
